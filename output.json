            "content": "Stay informed with free updatesSimply sign up to the Retail sector myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.In retrospect, we did look a little pathetic.“This is a £2.10 receipt,” said the kindly but bemused lady at the M&S checkouts.We mumbled something about being very diligent about our expenses. She told us to try customer services online.FT Alphaville’s mission: get a VAT receipt for the heavily-discounted sandwich that we bought last Wednesday. Having recently learned that statutory rights are more powerful than supermarket press officers — and after successfully completing this task for Tesco’s birthday cake sandwich earlier in the week — we felt like empowered consumers.A VAT receipt would give us an answer to the question that has been plaguing Britain since sometime in late June: what is the tax status of the Marks and Spencer ‘Red Diamond™ Strawberry & Creme on soft sweetened bread’ (RDSC)?There were two possibilities:— M&S was charging zero per cent VAT on the sandwich, in line with the VAT exemption for foods (which includes cold sandwiches and cakes).— M&S was charging 20 per cent VAT on the sandwich, in line with the exemption to that exemption to that exemption that puts standard VAT rating on confectionery.We believe it was and should be the former, but had been unable to find out… until now.Into the scanner our week-old receipt went, and — within minutes — we had a response (high-res for mobile users):Holy Marks and Spencers — there’s VAT on our sando!If you’re struggling to parse that table, it shows we were charged VAT at:— 20 per cent on our crisps (as expected);— zero per cent on our banana (as expected), and;— 13.71 per cent on “REDUCED”, aka our strawberry and creme sandwich (unexpected).Wait… 13.71 per cent?!This is simply not how VAT works — unless M&S is trying to pull some truly bizarre shenanigans involving an average rates for the constituent parts of the RDSC (also not how VAT works), this surely had to be a blunder, presumably involving how reduced items are treated.There was only one thing for it: we had to buy another sandwich.A short trip to M&S Simply Food later, and we were equipped with a full-price (£2.90) RDSC, and a receipt, which we swiftly sent off to M&S’s highest authorities (the accounts payable department).A reply came back quickly (high-res):After the previous jump-scare, we had a more concrete answer: as expected, there’s no VAT on the RDSC — a fact which makes a future court showdown over this item a little more likely.The reduced-price sandwich VAT application remains a mystery, but it’s one for another day. Anyone who wants to go to M&S and demand not to be charged VAT on their discounted sando… please do so and let us know how it goes.FTAV’s soul was at peace. But there was one problem left: what to do with the sandwich we now owned? Luckily, colleagues were on hand.Additional consumption by Nikou Asgari.Further reading:— Here’s 1,000 words about Tesco’s birthday cake sandwich, none of which concern how it tastes— A stale, taxing take on M&S’s viral strawberry ‘sando’",

            "content": "Unlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.There’s a real heartbeat in Cape Town – which sounds cheesy, but it’s a special city. A lot of people move here, it’s sort of the end goal. I have a little house on the beach in Bakoven, a suburb on the west coast. My friends and I are never not excited to wake up for the day. There’s always something to do.The view of Cape Town from Table Mountain © Courtesy Anita PatricksonAnita Patrickson at a friend’s house in South Africa Cape Town is casual in a lot of ways because of the ocean – people walk around with surfboards – but it’s also sophisticated. The whole city revolves around Table Mountain, which feels otherworldly, especially in the summer when everything explodes into life. Fynbos, the region’s natural shrubland, is really unique and biodiverse. It’s full of proteas, South Africa’s national flower, as well as sunbirds and sugarbirds. When you’re this close to nature everyone tends to be a little bit nicer. You can take a cable car or hike to the top of the mountain – Skeleton Gorge is a popular trail. Oranjezicht City Farm Market is probably the most picturesque farmer’s market in the worldIf you want to see African penguins, go to Boulders Beach. There is a viewing deck but the trick is to walk past it – you’ll find secret little beaches where penguins swim behind big boulders. They’re so freaking cute, I can’t handle it; they just sit on the rocks and watch you. You can have a picnic delivered there from Basketcase in Tamboerskloof. Bar Roc at Ellerman House © Claire GunnA sculpture in the garden at Ellerman House Chapman’s Peak Drive, just south of the city, is one of the most beautiful drives in the world. On one side you have verdant green cliffs, and on the other is Hout Bay. The views are mind-blowing. You’ll drive past Chefs Warehouse at Tintswalo Atlantic, a restaurant that’s good for lunch, but the dream is to snatch the sunset slot with a Martini. I’ve lived in New York, London and LA, and the food scene here rivals them all. On weekend mornings, I go to Oranjezicht City Farm Market, which is probably the most picturesque farmer’s market in the world. Everyone stops to get a croissant at Jason Bakery, and I always go to the cheese stand and Adene’s Farm Flowers. The exterior of Belmond Mount Nelson  Further south of the city, La Colombe has a fun tasting menu that’s unbelievably creative. One dish that’s always on the menu is Tuna La Colombe, which is served in a sealed tuna tin that you open yourself. And if you want something really special, take a helicopter north up the coast to Wolfgat, a restaurant in a little fishing village called Paternoster. They forage for everything and the wines are all local. It’s magical to watch the fishermen bring in their boats, with the gulls flocking to try to catch bits of fish. South African wine is also obviously very good. Take a day trip to Franschhoek or Stellenbosch, the two wine areas just outside the city; Franschhoek has a really fun old-fashioned tram tour. If you’re in a girly group or want to take it down a level, stay at Sterrekopje Farm, a dreamy spa retreat there. My favourite hotels in Cape Town are Mount Nelson and Ellerman House, which is on the water and has a phenomenal art collection.A bathroom at Sterrekopje Farm The seating area of a suite at Sterrekopje © Elsa YoungEveryone’s very resourceful here, and there’s a real culture of being good with your hands. My business, Amanu, is a very African brand – not just in the design but the manufacturing and the ethos. Our sandals, bags and belts are handmade here in Cape Town as well as in Kenya, and we work with low-income community members to upskill and provide jobs. Patrickson at Sterrekopje Farm The Norval Foundation and the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa are amazing art museums, and you can go gallery-hopping around Bree Street. A favourite is What If The World, where I recently bought a piece by Chris Soal, who makes pieces out of toothpicks that look like coral. Merchants On Long curates South African homeware and clothing, while Chandler House is great if you’re looking for fun gifts by local artisans. It’s in Bo-Kaap, an area with brightly coloured houses and cobbled streets. The community there is predominantly Muslim, so you’ll often hear the mosque calling for prayer. South Africa is a melting pot and there’s a really beautiful fusion of cultures in Cape Town. People love this city and are very loyal to it. BARS, CAFÉS AND RESTAURANTSJason Bakery jasonbakery.comLa Colombe lacolombe.restaurant/la-colombeOranjezicht City Farm Market ozcf.co.zaTintswalo tintswalo.comWolfgat wolfgat.co.zaTHINGS TO DOBoulders Beach sanparks.orgFranschhoek Wine Tram winetram.co.zaNorval Foundation norvalfoundation.orgZeitz MOCAA zeitzmocaa.museumSHOPPINGAmanu amanustudio.comBasketcase basketcase.co.zaChandler House chandlerhouse.co.zaMerchants On Long merchantsonlong.co.zaWhat If The World whatiftheworld.comWHERE TO STAYEllerman House ellerman.co.zaMount Nelson belmond.comSterrekopje Farm sterrekopje.com",

            "title": "A locals’ guide to Los Angeles: essential advice for unlocking the city",
            "content": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter’s guide to Los AngelesLos Angeles is, famously, a dreamy town that can feel vast and unknowable on first, second, even third visit. Which $23 smoothie could justify such a purchase? How do you choose from a row of identical looking taco spots? You may get stuck driving from East to West at the worst time, and decide the city’s not all they say. As FT US media editor Anna Nicolaou says, “Los Angeles is not at all a succinct city.” For it to truly reveal itself, you need local knowledge.As part of our guide to Los Angeles, we asked FT readers, colleagues, and Angelenos for their rules to the city: how to drive, what to see, what to skip, what makes LA special, what spots are not just buzzy but actually great. The result is this list of excellent advice, lightly edited for clarity and length. Bookmark it, share it, and follow us for more.We’re also still collecting your advice on LA neighbourhoods, which you can share with us here.Rules for handling the sprawl and the traffic“LA is secretly a bunch of tiny towns all sewn together, and each neighbourhood/tiny town has one or two major thoroughfares where all the bars and restaurants are. When planning a trip, utilise that knowledge and plan accordingly. Also, traffic is bad going west in the AM and going east in the PM.” — Kelly, producer, Los Angeles“LA is so vast that if you are visiting for a limited time, prioritisation and strategically deciding where to stay based on your interests is key. If you gravitate towards beaches you’ll want to stay near the coast. If you want the touristy entertainment stops, stay near Hollywood and/or the movie studios, which you can tour. If you want art museums, stay a manageable distance to both the Getty and LACMA. If you like to hike, stay further east, closer to the San Gabriel Mountains.” — Jay Seawell, entertainment marketing, Sierra Madre“Rent a car and use it as an opportunity to see LA holistically. And have patience. Yes there is traffic, yes some things take longer to get to. Embrace it with a relaxed attitude.” — Liana Aghajanian, journalist (Her piece for us on Altadena after the fires is a must-read), Los Angeles“Find a neighbourhood to explore with a bookstore, like Echo Park, Leimert Park, Silver Lake, Abbot Kinney, Boyle Heights or Highland Park and spend an afternoon walking around, going to a local café and checking out the scene. There are very different demographics and very friendly people all over this huge city. I tell people it’s kind of like Berlin.” — Barbara Bestor, architect, Silver LakeRules for getting the best out of the city“Get to know your street vendors. Learn some basic Spanish. EAT AT A STRIP MALL!!! The best food in LA is street food or tiny local vendors who’ve been there forever. Fine dining is just fine here, nothing to write home about. Strip-mall fare? Now that’s something special.” — Kelly (Editor’s note: may we recommend our dining guide to East Hollywood?) “Definitely talk to strangers. Everyone has a story to tell about how they got to LA.” — Kathy, administrative assistant in finance, Los Angeles“Look up at the trees. Even downtown, they’re so beautiful and they’re EVERYWHERE. It always shocks me.” — Anna Nicolaou, FT US media editor, frequent LA work traveller, New York“Approach Erewhon [the viral smoothie chain] like you would a casino: go in with an amount of money in mind you’re prepared to lose, and don’t go over it.” — India Ross, FT deputy news editor“Eat tacos — from a truck, not a sit-down restaurant. Don’t walk on the cycling path on the Strand. Yes, take the drive to the San Gabriel Valley — the Sichuan food is worth it. By all means visit the Salt Sauna at Wi Spa in Koreatown, but don’t hold the [steamroom] door open.” — Christopher Grimes, FT LA bureau chief, Echo Park(Editor’s note: here’s our extremely detailed guide to where to eat tacos)“Orient a day around the light — plan ahead where you’ll be for sunrise and sunset, and stick around after sunset. The show gets even more dramatic.” — Sebastian Buck, design, Mar Vista“Don’t search for ‘the centre’ of LA. And find views from above (like the road to Angeles National Forest or Mulholland Drive), preferably at night. — Christoph WaltzTouristy stuff you shouldn’t skip“Sometimes the most basic things are actually the best ones. Take an Uber up to the Griffith Observatory, walk 10 minutes along an easy trail and you’re suddenly surrounded by a breathtaking vista. It will smell amazing, the sun will be shining, the Hollywood sign will be right in front of you, you’ll have an aerial view of the city, hummingbirds will be chirping in your ear . . . It’s so beautiful and so easy.” — Anna“Lean into the glamour instead of making fun of it. 1) Yes to lunch at Chateau Marmont. 2) Don’t skip the Getty Center and Getty Villa. 3) Go for a hike. 4) Watch LA Story with Steve Martin before you go.” — Jessalyn Peters, Studio City(Editor’s note: here’s a collection of films about Los Angeles that our FT film critic Danny Leigh loves)“Do a studio tour. I recommend Warner Bros. It’s so fun, nostalgic and satisfying to ride around in a golf cart with a coffee in hand, whilst seeing how so many movies and TV shows are made and snapping photos on sets.” — Bridgette Birk, travel/hospitalityStereotypes you shouldn’t fall for“That it is a cultural wasteland: it is, in fact, a city of great museums, restaurants, architecture, small repertory theatres (where major TV stars hone their craft) and, of course, the best weather in the continental US. Having lived in northern and southern California, LA is much the friendlier of the two and has a great creative spirit.” — Todd Gerken, retired, former LA resident, Savannah GA“That it is a chill, relaxed place. There are highly-strung people here like anywhere! The abundance of sunshine and palm trees probably conveys a sense of lightness that contributes to this stereotype, and the energy here is not the same as in East Coast cities, but having lived here for a number of years now I wouldn’t really call it ‘chill’.” — Jay“That you NEED a car. It’s actually pretty easy to get around with the metro and a bicycle.” — Andrew Meredith, skateboarder and artist, East Hollywood“That we have no seasons. LA has three microclimates: the coast, the desert inland and the in-between chaparral. The coast may not change much, but the other two have serious summers, and cooler winters that can hover just above freezing at night.” — Aria Safar, investor and graphic designer, Silver Lake“That it’s an anti-intellectual city. A number of the top research institutions in the world are in the Greater LA area (UCLA, Caltech, JPL) which means that lots of brilliant people live here. Also, people should stop comparing LA to East Coast and European cities. We are much more of a Latino or Asian city in terms of urban development.” — RachelReasons to love LA“The optimism . . . people embrace the new and unproven without the scepticism found elsewhere. That spirit is precious and fragile — enjoy it and don’t crush it.” — Sebastian“Multiculturalism is our native language. It is a city very divided by class but we all grew up on tacos, Korean barbecue, pupusas, kebabs, soup dumplings, bagels, pho and boba.” — Rachel“As a kid growing up in New York, LA always had this mythical quality to it. As an adult, I still find it mythical and exciting. There’s something about how all these people move here for a totally outlandish dream, and how beautiful and scary the physical landscape is, that makes the city feel like magic.” — Anna“It’s an influence magnifier. It makes you feel different about being American. So much of what we think of as quintessentially American was born in LA and California.” — Todd“We are a proud city, but also deeply private. One person’s reality and perception of the city can be so different than [those of] someone who lives 20 minutes away.” — Name withheld“There’s truly no way you can ever get bored or feel obliged to pay an enormous amount of money for a good time.” — Name withheld“It is a city of immigrants, through and through. For the people that live here, as for our parents and great great grandparents, Los Angeles represents the dynamism of immigrants who came here for a better life or were displaced here . . . This also means it has proper, unaffected, ethnic local cuisine. Food culture assimilates in cities like NY or London more rapidly. Because of the urban design and open space in LA, cultural neighbourhoods are more segregated. That has its problems, but it has also insulated many of its culinary identities from gentrification and being watered down.” — Treyton Littlejohn, nonprofit director, Los AngelesTravel and driving tips“Hollywood Burbank Airport! Easy pick-up and drop-off, minimal lines when it comes to security and you can be in the city proper within 20 minutes of getting off the plane.” — Phoebe Ng, creative communications and hospitality strategist, former LA resident, New York“There are two San Vicente Boulevards and they don’t connect.” — Rachel Gandin Mark, director of international programs, USC School of Cinematic Arts, Los Angeles“People may think I’m obnoxious for saying this, but if you’re new to driving, have some disposable income and valet is an option, take it. It’s expensive, but it’s less expensive than dinging somebody’s Tesla while you’re trying to parallel park downhill.” — Jocelyn Silver, culture journalist, Los Angeles“Take the side streets, not the highway. LA is far more beautiful than most visitors realise. The main commercial thoroughfares are unfortunately mostly quite ugly, whereas the hidden residential side streets are some of the loveliest in any major city.” — John B, consultant, former LA resident, LondonOverrated things (a highly disputed category!)Hollywood Walk of Fame“Definitely do NOT go to the Chinese Theatre area in Hollywood with the Walk of Fame. It’s somehow even worse than Times Square, and that’s honestly pretty depressing.” — Anna“Hollywood. Dirty, not much to see and way too touristy. Does not capture the real spirit of the city.” — JaySeven people, however, recommended Musso & Frank Grill as an exception, “for classic Old Hollywood charm” which has been around since 1919: great martinis, sit at the bar. Also, Jocelyn likes the Hollywood stars: “Bear in mind that the neighbourhood is a bit creepy, but it’s so fun if you love the movies.”Santa Monica and Venice“Don’t eat anywhere on Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica except Ivy at the Shore.” — Whitney“Venice Beach. Tourist trap, lost its charm.” — Annie Wenzlau, interior designer, Echo Park“Don’t bother visiting the beach in Venice or Santa Monica — it’s gross! For the beach, anywhere north, from Will Rogers State Beach through Malibu, or in the South Bay, is really the way to go (or take a drive to Laguna Beach for some of the clearest, cleanest water in California).” — Jocelyn“Venice isn’t overt or trying to win you over — it’s subtle and hidden in small gardens and tucked-away restaurants. Avoid the boardwalk. Santa Monica is a more adult experience of Venice. Mar Vista, next to Venice, is a little quieter and more residential, and has great restaurants like Beethoven, Little Fatty and Blueys.” — Sebastian“Explore the neighbourhoods around Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice — the hidden garden paths are a treasure.” — ChrisA few non-touristy things you should try“Take a ride on one of the new subways; the stations are incredible.” — Todd“A stroll along the Los Angeles River near Frogtown with lunch at Spoke café.” — Jessalyn“If you like the movies, something beautiful about LA is that some theatre somewhere is always screening something fantastic that you never thought you’d be able to see on the big screen — check the website Revival Hub for a list of everything playing on any given day.” — Jocelyn“Walk through historic core of downtown LA: the Bradbury Building, the Public Library, The Biltmore hotel and 1970s landmark the Bonaventure Hotel. Then, it’s a quick ride up the Angels Flight public cableway to the cultural hub of contemporary architecture landmarks: The Broad museum, LA Philharmonic (the public gardens and aerial pathway above street level are fantastic and underutilised), the Los Angeles cathedral and the 1960s classic Department of Water and Power building, which has an amazing modernist lobby. These are architectural delights spanning the past 100-plus years. There are amazing food options at the Grand Central Market right in the middle of it all.” — BarbaraDo you have more tips?
